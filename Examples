System.assertEquals ()

Syntax: System.assertEquals(expected, actual, message)
This method is part of the System class in Apex.
It checks whether the expected value is equal to the actual value.
If the assertion fails, it provides a more detailed error message with the optional message parameter.

/*with separate Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() for each method, 
is a good practice as it keeps the scope of each test method isolated. It's a recommended practice to follow for writing effective and reliable unit tests in Salesforce.*/

//using Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() ensures that the asynchronous operations are completed before moving on to the assertions.
